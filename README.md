# About this project
The project consists of providing answers to the various subscribers of the platform.
We have three actors, the user, the HR and the psychologist. 

The psychologist adds a questionnaire in the form of questions and answers. Its latest are in True / False format. 

The addition can be done manually (through the platform) or automatically by loading a CSV file. HR assigns each user the questionnaire to be taken (manually or randomly) The user answers the questions the result is sent to the psychologist and the HR is just informed of the sending (does not receive the content). 

Finally, the psychologist sends recommendations to the user. N.B: The user can re-take the questionnaire and if there is the same concern on the same question, the psychologist can propose other recommendations. Note : This projet was done by the collaboration of three other people including me .
